## Overview

**Gashadokuro** (がしゃどくろ) are enormous skeletal yokai in Japanese folklore, standing approximately **15 times the height of an average human**. They form when the bones of people who died of starvation—particularly victims of war, famine, or mass death—fuse together, animated by their collective resentment and hunger.

These terrifying creatures possess the ability to **turn invisible** and are **indestructible** by conventional means. They wander at night making a distinctive "gachi gachi" rattling sound, seeking travelers to grab, crush, and devour. The only warning is a **ringing in the ears** that signals a gashadokuro's approach.

A gashadokuro cannot be destroyed but will eventually dissipate once the vengeful energy of the starved dead is exhausted—a process that may take years or decades.

## Origins & Formation

### How Gashadokuro Form

**Cause**: Mass death by starvation

**Mechanism**: When many people die of starvation—particularly during war, famine, or siege—their bones may fuse together through the power of their collective grudge and resentment.

**Triggering Events**:
- Warfare causing mass starvation
- Natural famines killing large populations
- Siege conditions leading to starvation deaths
- Any mass starvation event where victims died hungry and forgotten

**Energy Source**: Collective malice and resentment of those who died hungry, abandoned, and unremembered

**Lifespan**: Exists until the vengeful energy dissipates naturally (years to decades)

---

## Defense & Survival

### Weaknesses

| Weakness | Description | Effectiveness |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Time** | Eventually dissipates as grudge energy exhausts | Certain but slow (years) |
| **Warning system** | Ear ringing provides advance warning | Preventative |

### Survival Strategies

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Gashadokuro **CANNOT** be destroyed, defeated, or fought.

**Only defense is avoidance:**

1. **Heed the warning**: Flee immediately upon hearing ear ringing
2. **Listen for rattling**: "Gachi gachi" sound means it's already close—run
3. **Stay indoors at night**: Gashadokuro only hunt outdoors after dark
4. **Avoid traveling alone**: Prefer populated areas and group travel
5. **Respect the dead**: Proper burial and memorial for starvation victims may prevent formation

**If Encountered**:
- **DO**: Run immediately, seek shelter indoors
- **DON'T**: Attempt to fight (futile), freeze in fear, investigate the sound
