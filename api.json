      "full": "Gashadokuro are enormous skeletal yokai in Japanese folklore, standing approximately 15 times the height of an average human. They form when the bones of people who died of starvation—particularly victims of war, famine, or mass death—fuse together, animated by their collective resentment and hunger. These creatures possess the ability to turn invisible and are indestructible by conventional means. They wander at night making a distinctive 'gachi gachi' rattling sound, seeking travelers to grab and devour. The only warning is a ringing in the ears. A gashadokuro cannot be destroyed but will eventually dissipate once the vengeful energy of the starved dead is exhausted. While relatively modern in yokai tradition (19th century), gashadokuro gained fame through Utagawa Kuniyoshi's 1844 woodblock print depicting Princess Takiyasha summoning a giant skeleton."
